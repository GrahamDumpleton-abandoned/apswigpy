Welcome to APSWIGPY

The apswigpy package contains Python bindings for Apache server internals
generated using SWIG.

The bindings can be used in conjunction with mod_wsgi to get access to raw
Apache API, bypassing the more restrictive WSGI interface.

Installation (UNIX)
===================

To setup the package ready for building run the "configure" script.

    ./configure

The configure script takes the following optional arguments.

  --with-apxs=NAME        name of the apxs executable [apxs]
  --with-apr-config=NAME  name of the apr-config executable [apr-config]
  --with-apu-config=NAME  name of the apu-config executable [apu-config]
  --with-python=NAME      name of the python executable [python]
  --with-swig=NAME        name of the swig executable [swig]

The versions of Apache, APR, APR-UTIL and Python must all match what was
used when version of mod_wsgi to be used was built.

Once the package has been configured, it can be built by running:

    make

To install the Python package into the standard location for Python packages
as dictated by your Python installation, run:

    make install

Installation should be done as the root user if appropriate.

Note that the package must exist in the base Python installation that
mod_wsgi is configured to use. That is, the standard site-packages
directory for the Python installation mod_wsgi is using, or a baseline
Python virtual environment configured in mod_wsgi using WSGIPythonHome. The
package cannot be installed in a secondary Python virtual environment
referenced by the WSGIPythonPath directive, the python-path option to the
WSGIDaemonProcess directive, or any which has been explicit added to
sys.path within the WSGI application. This is because mod_wsgi will load
the package at startup before any such secondary Python virtual
environments have been added to sys.path.

To cleanup after installation, run:

    make clean

If you need to build the module for a different version of Apache or
Python, you should run:

    make distclean

and then rerun "configure" against the alternate version of Apache and
Python before attempting to run "make" again.
